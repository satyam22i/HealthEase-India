      <h4>Understanding Mental Health Disorders: A Simple Guide</h4>
      <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health, and it’s something that everyone has. Just like we can
        get sick with a cold or a fever, our minds can also have problems, and that’s what we call mental health
        disorders. Let’s explore what mental health disorders are, how they affect people, and how we can help those who
        are dealing with them.</p>
      <div id="rabimg"><img src="mh1.png" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      <h4>What Are Mental Health Disorders?</h4>
      <p>Mental health disorders are problems that affect how people think, feel, and behave. Just like how a broken leg
        can make it hard to walk, a mental health disorder can make it hard for someone to handle their emotions or to
        do everyday things. Some people might feel very sad, others might feel very anxious or worried, and some might
        have trouble thinking clearly.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Common Mental Health Disorders</h4>
      <p>There are many different types of mental health disorders. Here are a few that you might hear about:</p>
      <ol>

        <li>
          <h5>Depression: </h5>This is when someone feels very sad or empty for a long time. They might not enjoy things
          they used to like
          and might feel tired all the time. It’s like having a cloud over their head that doesn’t go away.
        <li>
          <h5>Anxiety: </h5>
        </li>This is when someone feels very worried or scared, even when there’s no real danger. They might feel their
        heart racing or have trouble sleeping because they’re so worried about things that might happen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h5>This is when it’s hard for someone to focus on one
          thing or to sit still. They might find it hard to pay attention in school or to stay quiet when they need to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Autism: </h5>This is a condition that affects how someone thinks and interacts with others. People with
          autism might find it hard to understand social cues or to talk to others in the same way most people do.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br>
      <h4>How Do We Know If Someone Has a Mental Health Disorder?</h4>
      <p>Sometimes it can be hard to tell if someone has a mental health disorder because they don’t always look sick.
        They might not show any signs on the outside, but they might be feeling very sad, scared, or confused on the
        inside. If you notice that a friend is acting differently, like not playing with you as much or seeming very
        worried, they might need some help. It’s important to be kind and not to judge them.</p>
      <h4>Helping Others with Mental Health Disorders</h4>
      <p>If you think someone you know might have a mental health disorder, there are things you can do to help:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h5>Be a Good Friend: </h5>Sometimes, just being there for someone can make a big difference. Let them know
          you care and that you’re there to listen if they want to talk
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Encourage Them to Seek Help: </h5>Sometimes, people need a little help from doctors or counselors who are
          trained to help with mental health. You can gently encourage your friend to talk to a trusted adult, like a
          parent, teacher, or school counselor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Learn More: </h5>
          Understanding more about mental health can help you be more supportive. There are many books and websites that
          explain mental health in a way that’s easy to understand.

        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Be Kind: </h5>
          Always be kind and understanding. People with mental health disorders often feel very lonely or misunderstood.
          Your kindness can help them feel better and more accepted.

        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Why It’s Important to Talk About Mental Health</h4>
      <p>Talking about mental health is important because it helps break the stigma, or negative feelings, that some
        people have about mental health disorders. When we talk openly about mental health, we can help more people get
        the help they need and make sure everyone feels supported and understood.
        <br>
        Remember, just like we take care of our bodies, we need to take care of our minds too. If you or someone you
        know is struggling, it’s okay to ask for help. Being healthy means feeling good in both your body and your mind.
