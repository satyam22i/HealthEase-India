    <h4>Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines </h4>

    <br>

    <h2 id="heading">What causes gastroenteritis</h2>
    <p>There can be many different causes of gastroenteritis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Viruses</li>
      <li>Bacteria</li>
      <li>Parasites</li>
      <li>Chemicals</li>
      <li>Reactions to certain medicines and foodViral</li>
    </ul>
    <p>gastroenteritis is the most common type. It can be caused by many different viruses, including noroviruses and
      rotaviruses. Some people call viral gastroenteritis the "stomach flu." But this name is not medically correct. It
      is not caused by flu viruses. The flu is a respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat and lungs.
      When gastroenteritis is caused by consuming foods or drinks contaminated with viruses, bacteria, parasites, or
      chemicals, this is called food poisoning.
      The viruses, bacteria, and parasites that cause gastroenteritis can also spread from person to person. You could
      be infected when you touch something that has the germs on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.
