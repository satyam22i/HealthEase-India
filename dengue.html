    <h2 id="heading">Dengue hemorrhagic fever</h2>
    <p>Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a variant presentation of dengue infection that occurs primarily in children < 10
        years living in areas where dengue is endemic. Dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is an
        immunopathologic disease; dengue virus–antibody immune complexes trigger release of vasoactive mediators by
        macrophages. The mediators increase vascular permeability, causing vascular leakage, hemorrhagic manifestations,
        hemoconcentration, and serous effusions, which can lead to circulatory collapse (ie, dengue shock syndrome).
        </p>
        <div id="rabimg"><img src="dengue1.png" alt="img1"></div>

        <h2 id="heading">Symptoms and Signs </h2>
        <p>Dengue hemorrhagic fever often begins with abrupt fever and headache and is initially indistinguishable from
          classic dengue. Warning signs that predict possible progression to severe dengue include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Severe abdominal pain and tenderness</li>
          <li>Persistent vomiting</li>

          <li>Hematemesis Epistaxis or bleeding from the gums</li>
          <li>Black, tarry stools (melena)</li>

          <li>Edema Lethargy, confusion, or restlessness</li>
          <li>Hepatomegaly, pleural effusion, or ascites</li>
          <li>Marked change in temperature (from fever to hypothermia)</li>
          <li>Circulatory collapse and multiorgan failure, called dengue shock syndrome, may develop rapidly 2 to 6 days
            after onset.</li>
          <p>Bleeding tendencies manifest as follows:</p>
          <li>Usually as purpura, petechiae, or ecchymoses at injection sites</li>
          <li>Sometimes as hematemesis, melena, or epistaxis</li>
          <li> Sometimes as hematemesis, melena, or epistaxis</li>
          <p>
            Bronchopneumonia with or without bilateral pleural effusions is common. Myocarditis can occur.
            Mortality is usually < 1% in experienced centers but otherwise can range to up 30%. </p>

        <div id="heading">Diagnosis </div>
        <p>Clinical and laboratory criteria</p>
        <ul>

          <h5> Dengue hemorrhagic fever is suspected in children with World Health Organization–defined clinical
            criteria for the diagnosis.</h5>
          <li>Sudden fever that stays high for 2 to 7 days</li>
          <li>Hemorrhagic manifestations include at least a positive tourniquet test and petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses,
            bleeding gums, hematemesis, or melena. The tourniquet test is done by inflating a blood pressure cuff to
            midway between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure for 15 minutes. The number of petechiae that form
            within a 2.5-cm diameter circle are counted; > 20 petechiae suggests capillary fragility.
            Complete blood count, coagulation tests, urinalysis, liver tests, and dengue serologic tests should be done.
            Coagulation abnormalities include
          </li>
          <li>
            Thrombocytopenia (≤ 100,000 platelets/mcL [≤ 100 x 109/L])
          </li>
          <li>A prolonged prothrombin time (PT)</li>
          <li>Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT)</li>
          <p>Decreased fibrinogen
            •
            •
            Increased amount of fibrin split products
            •
            There may be hypoproteinemia, mild proteinuria, and increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.
            Serological diagnosis can be made using the IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA).
            Combined with the dengue virus RNA amplification test, it can provide a diagnosis within the first 1 to 7
            days of illness. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is specific and sensitive. Titers in acute
            and convalescent phase serum samples can reliably establish dengue virus infection and may indicate the
            specific dengue virus type involved. The PRNT requires live dengue viruses for the test and is
            labor-intensive and expensive. Many laboratories are not able to do the PRNT.
            Patients with World Health Organization-defined clinical criteria plus thrombocytopenia (≤ 100,000/mcL [≤
            100 x 109/L]) or hemoconcentration (Hct increased by ≥ 20%) are presumed to have the disease (see the
            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Dengue Virus: Clinical Guidance).

        <div id="rabimg"><img src="denguePicture3.png" alt="img3"></div>
        <p>Supportive care

          Patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever require intensive treatment to maintain euvolemia. Both hypovolemia
          (which can cause shock) and overhydration (which can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome) should be
          avoided. Urine output and the degree of hemoconcentration can be used to monitor intravascular volume.
          No antivirals have been shown to improve outcome.

        <h3 id="heading">When to see a doctor</h3>
        <p>Severe dengue fever is a life-threatening medical emergency. Seek immediate medical attention if you've
          recently visited an area in which dengue fever is known to occur, you have had a fever and you develop any of
          the warning signs. Warning signs include severe stomach pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, or blood in your
          nose, gums, vomit or stools.
          If you've been traveling recently and develop a fever and mild symptoms of dengue fever, call your doctor.
        </p>
        <h3 id="heading">Risk factors</h3>
        <p>You have a greater risk of developing dengue fever or a more severe form of the disease if:
          You live or travel in tropical areas. Being in tropical and subtropical areas increases your risk of exposure
          to the virus that causes dengue fever. Especially high-risk areas include Southeast Asia, the western Pacific
          islands, Latin America and Africa.
          You have had dengue fever in the past. Previous infection with a dengue fever virus increases your risk of
          severe symptoms if you get dengue fever again.
        </p>
        <h3 id="heading">Complications</h3>
        <p>Severe dengue fever can cause internal bleeding and organ damage. Blood pressure can drop to dangerous
          levels, causing shock. In some cases, severe dengue fever can lead to death.
          Women who get dengue fever during pregnancy may be able to spread the virus to the baby during childbirth.
          Additionally, babies of women who get dengue fever during pregnancy have a higher risk of pre-term birth, low
          birth weight or fetal distress.
        </p>

        <h3 id="heading">Prevent mosquito bites</h3>
        <p>The World Health Organization stresses that the vaccine is not an effective tool on its own to reduce dengue
          fever in areas where the illness is common. Preventing mosquito bites and controlling the mosquito population
          are still the main methods for preventing the spread of dengue fever.
          If you live in or travel to an area where dengue fever is common, these tips may help reduce your risk of
          mosquito bites:
          <br>
        <h5>Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened housing.</h5>
        <p>The mosquitoes that carry the dengue viruses are most active from dawn to dusk, but they can also bite at
          night.</p>
        <h5>Wear protective clothing</h5>
        <p>When you go into mosquito-infested areas, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes.</p>
        <h5>Use mosquito repellent</h5>
        <p>Permethrin can be applied to your clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting. You can also buy clothing
          made with permethrin already in it. For your skin, use a repellent containing at least a 10% concentration of
          DEET.</p>
        <h5>Reduce mosquito habitat</h5>
        <p>The mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus typically live in and around houses, breeding in standing water
          that can collect in such things as used automobile tires. You can help lower mosquito populations by
          eliminating habitats where they lay their eggs. At least once a week, empty and clean containers that hold
          standing water, such as planting containers, animal dishes and flower vases. Keep standing water containers
          covered between cleanings.</p>
