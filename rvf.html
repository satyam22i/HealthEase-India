    <h2 id="heading">Rift Valley fever</h2>

    <p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is most commonly seen in domesticated animals
      (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels) and can cause illness in people. The disease is caused by Rift
      Valley Fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus in the order Bunyavirales.

    </p>
    <div id="rabimg"><img src="rvf 1.jpg" alt="img1"></div>

    <p>Outbreaks of RVF can have major societal impacts, including significant economic losses and trade reductions. The
      disease most commonly affects livestock, causing severe illness and abortion in domesticated animals, an important
      income source for many. Outbreaks of disease in animal populations are called “epizootics.” The most notable RVF
      epizootic occurred in Kenya in 1950-1951, resulting in the death of an estimated 100,000 sheep.</p>

    <h2 id="heading">Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    <p>RVFV has an incubation period of 2-6 days following exposure to the virus and can cause several different disease
      syndromes if symptoms do appear. Most commonly, people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness that
      includes fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness at the onset of illness. Typically, patients recover within two
      days to one week after symptoms start.
      RVFA small percentage (8-10%) of people infected with V develop much more severe symptoms, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Ocular disease (disease of the eye), which sometimes accompanies the mild symptoms described above. Lesions
          on the eyes may occur 1-3 weeks after onset of initial symptoms with patients reporting blurred and decreased
          vision. For many patients, lesions disappear after 10-12 weeks; however, for those with lesions occurring in
          the macula (the center of the retina), about half will have permanent vision loss.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures. This occurs in
          less than 1% of patients and presents 1-4 weeks after first symptoms appear. Death from encephalitis in RVF
          patients is rare, but neurological deficits may be severe and long-lasting.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hemorrhagic fever, which occurs in less than 1% of all RVF patients. Symptoms of hemorrhaging may begin
          with jaundice and other signs of liver impairment, followed by vomiting blood, bloody stool, or bleeding from
          gums, skin, nose, and injection sites. These symptoms appear 2-4 days after onset of illness. Fatality for
          those who do develop symptoms of hemorrhagic fever is around 50% and death usually occurs 3-6 days after
          symptoms start.</p>
      </li>


    </ul>
    <p>RVF causes severe disease in animals that is characterized by fever, weakness, abortions (loss of pregnancy), and
      a high rate of severe illness and death, particularly among young animals. RVFV infection causes abortion in
      nearly 100% of livestock pregnancies and most young animals that are infected will die, whereas fatality among
      adult animals is significantly lower.</p>
    <h2 id="heading">Risk of Exposure</h2>
    <p>Spending time in rural areas and sleeping outdoors at night in regions where outbreaks of RVF occur could be risk
      factors for exposure to mosquitoes and other insect vectors. People who work with or butcher/handle raw meat from
      potentially-infected animals in RVF-endemic areas (areas where the virus is known to occur) have an increased risk
      for infection. This could include animal herdsmen and farmers, abattoir (slaughterhouse) workers, veterinarians,
      and other people who work with animals and animal products. Laboratory workers who may be exposed to the RVF virus
      may also be at risk.</p>

    <h2 id="heading">Treatment</h2>
    <p>There are no FDA-approved treatments for Rift Valley Fever (RVF). Since most cases of RVF are mild and
      self-limiting, a specific treatment for RVF has not been established. Symptoms of mild illness such as fever and
      body aches can be managed with standard over-the-counter medications. Most of the time, people will get better
      within two days to one week after their illness starts. Treatment for more serious cases may require
      hospitalization and are generally limited to supportive care.</p>

    <h2 id="heading">Prevention</h2>
    <p>People living in or visiting areas with Rift Valley Fever (RVF) can prevent infection with these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>• Avoid contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. People working with animals in
          RVF-endemic areas should wear appropriate protective equipment (such as gloves, boots, long sleeves, and a
          face shield) to avoid any exposure to blood or tissues of animals that may potentially be infected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use only safe animal products. All animal products (including meat, milk, and blood) should be thoroughly
          cooked before eating or drinking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Protect yourself against mosquitoes and other bloodsucking insects. Use insect repellents and bed nets, and
          wear long sleeved shirts and long pants to cover exposed skin.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>No vaccines are currently available for vaccination in people.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>A number of questions and challenges remain in the control and prevention of RVF. Scientists are still
      researching how the virus is maintained and spread within different mosquito species, and the risk factors
      associated with severe cases of RVF in people. Surveillance (close monitoring for RVF infection in animal and
      human populations) is essential to learning more about how RVF virus infection is spread and to formulating
      effective prevention measures. Establishing environmental monitoring and case surveillance systems may help to
      predict and control future RVF outbreaks.</p>

    <h2 id="heading">Animal Vaccination</h2>
    <p>Different types of vaccines are available for use in animals. Inactivated, or killed, vaccines are not practical
      in routine animal field vaccination because of the need for multiple doses. A modified live vaccine (the Smithburn
      vaccine) is one of the oldest and most widely used vaccines for controlling RVF in Africa. This vaccine only
      requires a single dose but is known to cause birth defects and abortions in pregnant livestock and may only
      provide cattle with limited protection from infection with RVF.
      Several candidate vaccines are being developed and evaluated. The live-attenuated vaccine, MP-12, has shown
      promising results in laboratory trials in domesticated animals, but more research is needed before the vaccine can
      be used in the field. The live-attenuated clone 13 vaccine was recently registered and used in South Africa.
      Alternative vaccines using molecular recombinant constructs are in development and show promising results.
