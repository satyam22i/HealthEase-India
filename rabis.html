    <h3>What is Rabies</h3>
    <p>Rabies is a neurological disease of mammals that is almost invariably fatal once the clinical signs
      develop. Humans are usually infected when they are bitten by an infected animal, or exposed to its saliva or
      central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Rabies can be effectively treated if the exposure is recognized before the
      symptoms develop. However, people in impoverished countries do not always have access to post-exposure
      prophylaxis, and even in nations with good medical care, cases occur occasionally in people who do not realize
      they were exposed</p>
    <div id="rabimg"><img src="rabies img 1.jpg" alt="img"></div>
    <p>Rabies virus (RABV) is a neurotropic, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. It belongs to the Rhabdoviridae
      family, genus Lyssavirus. RABV infection causes rabies in humans and other animals. They are characterized by an
      extremely broad host spectrum ranging from plants to insects and mammals. Rabies causes inflammation of the brain
      in humans and other mammals. Early symptoms of rabies include fever and tingling at the site of exposure, followed
      by one or more symptoms such as fear of water, violent movements, confusion, uncontrolled excitement, inability to
      move parts of the body, and loss of consciousness. The mortal rate is nearly 100% once the symptoms appear. the
      disease is 100% vaccine-preventable through the prompt administration of human postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and
      vaccination of animal reservoirs.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>INCUBATION PERIOD</h3>
    <p>Infections in Humans Incubation Period In humans, the incubation period is a few days to several years. Most
      cases become apparent after 1 to 3 months. In one study, approximately 4-10% of cases had an incubation period of
      6 months or more.</p>
    <div id="rabimg"> <img src="rabies img 3.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <h3>CLINICAL SIGN</h3>
    <p>Clinical Signs The early symptoms may include nonspecific prodromal signs such as malaise, fever or headache, as
      well as discomfort, pain, pruritus or sensory alterations at the site of virus entry. After several days, anxiety,
      confusion and agitation may appear, and progress to insomnia, abnormal behavior, hypersensitivity to light and
      sound, delirium, hallucinations, slight or partial paralysis, hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing, pharyngeal
      spasms upon exposure to liquids, and convulsions. Either an encephalitic (furious) form with hyperexcitability,
      autonomic dysfunction and hydrophobia, or a paralytic (dumb) form characterized by generalized paralysis, may
      predominate. Death usually occurs within 2 to 10 days; survival is extremely rare.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu and may last for days.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Later signs and symptoms may include:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Feve</li>
      <li>Headache</li>
      <li>Nausea</li>
      <li>Vomiting</li>
      <li>Agitation</li>
      <li>Anxiety</li>
      <li>Confusion</li>
      <li>Hyperactivity</li>
      <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
      <li>Excessive salivation</li>
      <li>Fear brought on by attempts to drink fluids because of difficulty swallowing water</li>
      <li>Fear brought on by air blown on the face</li>
      <li>Hallucinations</li>
      <li>Insomnia</li>
      <li>Partial paralysis</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
    <p>Seek immediate medical care if you're bitten by any animal, or exposed to an animal suspected of having rabies.
      Based on your injuries and the situation in which the exposure happened, you and your doctor can decide whether
      you should receive treatment to prevent rabies.

      Even if you aren't sure whether you've been bitten, seek medical attention. For instance, a bat that flies into
      your room while you're sleeping may bite you without waking you. If you awake to find a bat in your room, assume
      you've been bitten. Also, if you find a bat near a person who can't report a bite, such as a small child or a
      person with a disability, assume that person has been bitten.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>The rabies virus causes a rabies infection. The virus spreads through the saliva of infected animals. Infected
      animals can spread the virus by biting another animal or a person.
      In rare cases, rabies can be spread when infected saliva gets into an open wound or the mucous membranes, such as
      the mouth or eyes. This could happen if an infected animal licked an open cut on your skin.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Animals that can transmit the rabies virus</h3>
    <p>Any mammal (an animal that suckles its young) can spread the rabies virus. The animals most likely to spread the
      rabies virus to people include:</p>
    <p>Pets and farm animals</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cats</li>
      <li>Cows</li>
      <li>Dogs</li>
      <li>Ferrets</li>
      <li>Goats</li>
      <li>Horses</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Wild animals</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bats</li>
      <li>Beavers</li>
      <li>Coyotes</li>
      <li>Foxes</li>
      <li>Monkeys</li>
      <li>Raccoons</li>
      <li>Skunks</li>
      <li>Woodchucks</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Prevention</h3>
    <p>To reduce your risk of coming in contact with rabid animals:</p>
    <div id="rabimg"><img src="dog vaccine.avif" alt=""></div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Vaccinate your pets.</h4>
      </li>
      <p>Cats, dogs and ferrets can be vaccinated against rabies. Ask your veterinarian how often your pets should be
        vaccinated.</p>
      <li>
        <h4>Keep your pets confined</h4>
      </li>
      <p>Keep your pets inside and supervise them when outside. This will help keep your pets from coming in contact
        with wild animals</p>
      <li>
        <h4>Protect small pets from predators</h4>
      </li>
      <p>Keep rabbits and other small pets, such as guinea pigs, inside or in protected cages so that they are safe from
        wild animals. These small pets can't be vaccinated against rabies.</p>
      <li>
        <h4>Report stray animals to local authoritie</h4>
      </li>
      <p>Call your local animal control officials or other local law enforcement to report stray dogs and cats.</p>
      <li>
        <h4>Don't approach wild animals</h4>
      </li>
      <p>Wild animals with rabies may seem unafraid of people. It's not normal for a wild animal to be friendly with
        people, so stay away from any animal that seems unafraid.</p>
      <li>
        <h4>Keep bats out of your home</h4>
      </li>
      <p>Seal any cracks and gaps where bats can enter your home. If you know you have bats in your home, work with a
        local expert to find ways to keep bats out.</p>
      <li>
        <h4>Consider the rabies vaccine if you're traveling or often around animals that may have rabies.</h4>
      </li>
      <p>If you're traveling to a country where rabies is common and you'll be there for an extended period of time, ask
        your doctor whether you should receive the rabies vaccine. This includes traveling to remote areas where medical
        care is difficult to find.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>If you work as a veterinarian or work in a lab with the rabies virus, get the rabies vaccine.</p>
