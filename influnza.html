    <h2 id="heading">Avian influenza </h2>

    <p>Avian influenza refers to disease in birds caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses.
      Avian influenza A viruses have been isolated from more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world.
      These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird
      and
      animal species. Wild aquatic birds include waterbirds (waterfowl) such as ducks, geese, swans, gulls, and terns,
      and
      shorebirds, such as storks, plovers, and sandpipers. Wild aquatic birds, especially dabbling ducks, are considered
      reservoirs (hosts) for avian influenza A viruses. Wild aquatic birds can be infected with avian influenza A
      viruses
      in their intestines and respiratory tract, but some species, such as ducks, may not get sick. However, avian
      influenza A viruses are very contagious among birds, and some of these viruses can sicken and even kill certain
      domesticated bird species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys.</p>
    <div id="rabimg"><img src=" influnza img1.jpg" alt=""></div>

    <p>Although bird flu viruses mainly infect and spread among wild migratory water birds and domestic poultry, some
      bird flu viruses can infect and spread to other animals as well. Bird flu viruses have in the past been known to
      sometimes infect mammals that eat (presumably infected) birds or poultry, including but not limited to wild
      animals, such as seals, bears, foxes, skunks; farmed mink; stray or domestic animals, such as cats and dogs; and
      zoo animals, such as tigers and leopards. H5N1 bird flu viruses have been detected sporadically in some domestic
      animals, including cats during outbreaks in Thailand in 2004 and Northern Germany in 2006, and cats, dogs, and
      goat kids (juvenile goats) in North America. In December 2023, H5N1 virus infections were reported for the first
      time in mammals in both polar regions: an infected polar bear, which died in Alaska, and in elephant and fur seals
      in the Antarctic. While it’s unlikely that people would become infected with bird flu viruses through contact with
      an infected wild, stray, feral, or domestic mammal, it is possible—especially if there is prolonged and
      unprotected exposure to the animal. This page provides information for different groups of people who might have
      direct contact with infected or potentially infected sick or dead animals, including animals that might have eaten
      or been exposed to bird flu-infected birds</p>

    <h3>Protective actions around birds</h3>


    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As a general precaution, whenever possible people should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them
        only from a distance.

      </li>
      <li> Wild birds can be infected with avian (bird) influenza (flu) A viruses even if they don’t look sick.</li>
      <li> Avoid unprotected contact with domestic birds (poultry) that look sick or have died.</li>
      <li>Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or
        feces from wild or domestic birds.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <div id="rabimg"><img id="rabimg" src="infl img 3.jpg" alt="disease img3"></div>

    <p>Minimize contact with wild birds or sick or dead poultry by wearing gloves and washing your hands with soap and
      water after touching birds. Wear respiratory protection, such as an N95 respirator if available or, if not
      available, a well-fitting facemask (e.g., a surgical mask) </p>

    <h3>symptoms of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection may include</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery.</li>
      <li>aching muscles.</li>
      <li>headache.</li>
      <li>a cough or shortness of breath</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="rabimg"><img id="rabimg" src="influ img 4.jpg" alt="img 4"></div>

    <h3>Treatment consists of supportive care and antivirals</h3>
    <p>The disease can carry a high mortality in humans. Some antiviral drugs, if taken within two days of symptoms, may
      help.</p>

    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Antiviral drug</li>

    </ul>
    <p> Reduces viruses' ability to replicate.</p>
